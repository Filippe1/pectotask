This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First you need to download the project: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Filippe1/pectotask.git
```
You need to install sqlite3 and sqlite before you run the project:
```bash
npm install sqlite3
npm install sqlite
```
Open a terminal in the project folder and run the following code to create and populate the database:
```bash
node ./pages/database/sqlscript.js
```

Now you can run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Other Information
The sqlite database (which is the file rustofin.db generated in database folder) is generated by 
the sqlscript.js that populates the database from the data.json file.
